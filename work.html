<p>
  I work as a <B>Research Associate</B> at <B>Imperial College London</B>,
  working on the <A HREF="https://poets-project.org/">POETS project</A>. POETS
  is a novel parallel computing architecture, featuring many small
  hyperthreaded cores embedded in a parallel hardware communications
  infrastructure, and a new programming model to take advantage of this. This
  architecture provides fast communication capabilities between threads,
  and is highly scalable.
</p>

<p>
  My role consists of:
  <ul>
    <li>
      <B>Developing POETS applications for real-world examples</B> in multiple
      research fields, to make use of it's novel capabilities, and test it to
      its full extent. A large scale parallel architecture can have
      synchronisation problems, and I develop applications to use both
      synchronous and asynchronous algorithms, as either can be beneficial
      depending on the application.
    </li>

    <li>
      <B>Developing and maintaining tools for simulating, debugging and
      profiling the POETS platform</B>. These x86 tools are often parallel,
      and provide key insights to the inner-workings of the hardware and
      applications, which is difficult with this unconventional
      architecture.
    </li>
  </ul>

  My most important work for POETS has been the development of a <B>Dissipative
  Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulator</B>, as well as analytical and
  visualisation tools for this. DPD is a form of <B>molecular dynamics</B>, which
  abstracts away some more complex details of the molecules or particles under
  simulation, and simply looks at the interaction of them as polymers, and
  allows simulations to be run and detail behaviours between large numbers of
  particles in a shorter length of time compared with molecular dynamics.
