  <p>I am a PhD student at Newcastle University. My research focus is design methodology and automation for asynchronous circuits.
  My publications can be found <A HREF="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/publications.html">here</A>. </p>

  <p>Currently, I am working on a tool to ease the design of asynchronous circuits, called <em>concepts</em>. This is open source, and available at
  <A HREF="https://github.com/tuura/concepts/">github.com/tuura/concepts/</A>. A manual is included with the tool, and is also available in pdf format
  <A HREF="https://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-manual/manual.pdf">
  here</A></p>

  <p>There is also a blog available for concepts, discussing how they work, what concepts are available and how it can help with the design process. This is hosted at
  <A HREF="https://jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-blog/">jrbeaumont.github.io/concepts-blog/</A></p>

  <p>As an undergaduate, I acheived a MEng in Electronic and Computer Engineering from Newcastle University. During this time I learned much about both hardware, software and the
  interaction between them, such as real-time and embedded systems, and microprocessor systems. Throughout this time, I learned programming skills for both writing software, and for
  programming devices.</p>

  <p>I have knowledge of several programming languages.</p>

  <p>I am proficcient in: </p>

  <ul>
  <li>Java</li>
  <li>C</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Other languages I am familiar with are:</p>

  <ul>
  <li>Haskell</li>
  <li>Assembly language (68k)</li>
</ul>
