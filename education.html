<div class="education">

<p>
  I received a <B>MEng in Electronic and Computer Engineering</B> from
  <B>Newcastle University</B> in 2014. This provided me with skills in designing
  both electronics and software, and featured many projects in designing,
  building and testing embedded systems both on my own and in teams, for various
  purposes, such as an electronic drum kit recorder and an automatic maze
  mapping robot.
</p>

<p>
  In 2018 I completed my <B>PhD in Computer Engineering</B>, also at
  <B>Newcastle University</B>. During this time, I researched asynchronous
  circuits, systems and algorithms. These self-timed systems have many
  benefits, such as asynchronous circuits working at much low voltages, and
  asynchronous algorithms work efficiently to synchronise large-scale parallel
  systems.
